description: "The .ag file format for AI agent prompts—simple, flexible, and preserving author intent."
---

`.ag` files (or `.ag.md` during the transition) contain prompts written for AI agents. The format is simple:

- Pseudo-XML tags for semantic structure (not strict XML)
- Markdown content inside and between tags
- No attributes on tags
- Flexible whitespace—inline or block tags, as author intends

## Example

```text title="quarterly-report.ag"
You're a financial analyst at AcmeCorp. Generate a Q2 report.

<context>
AcmeCorp is a B2B SaaS company. Our investors value transparency.
</context>

<instructions>
1. Include sections: Revenue Growth, Profit Margins, Cash Flow
2. Highlight strengths and areas for improvement
</instructions>

Use this data:
<data>{{SPREADSHEET_DATA}}</data>
```

## Design principles

The format preserves author intent. Tooling validates and lints but does not reformat. What you write is what the agent receives.
